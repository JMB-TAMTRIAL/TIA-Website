# _Turn It Around_ Website
### Website Redesign for the _Turn It Around_ Organization


___


### Partner Info
The _Turn It Around_ organization seeks to become a nationally-recognized resource to foster an anti-bullying movement in schools. 



### Project Overview
The Partner's current site (http://turn-it-around.org) is considered "cluttered" and difficult to use. The website redesign's main objective is to improve site navigation and functionality—allowing visitors (often students or counselors) quick and easy access to existing support resources and program materials. Additionally, the website will serve as a new revenue stream for the Partner by selling memberships, coaching sessions and branded merchandise through an online store. Site design needs to be clean, image-forward, and include new branding and design elements from the organization's recent rebrand. 



### Website Goals:
+ improve website navigation through simplification;
+ utilize chatbot integration to provide quick access to free support resources and contact information;
+ streamline access to the _Turn It Around Site Programming Committee's_ existing free program information and materials;
+ show equal emphasis to the breadth of free resources available to students, teachers and counselors;
+ display a directory of national counselor resources listed by United States region;
+ restrict resource content based on membership tier—educators and nonprofits continuing to access the information for free;  
+ allow members to view and purchase coaching sessions developed by the programming board via sign-up from the website;
+ sell branded merchandise through an online store;
+ introduce new branding and design guidelines to present a more polished and cohesive web presence for the _Turn It Around_ organization and partners;
+ improve overall website performance and visibility in web searches via SEO (Search Engine Optimization.)
